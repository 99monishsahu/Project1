# Project1

### THYROID DETECTION
● Spearheaded the development of a machine learning classification model to predict thyroid types based on a
diverse training dataset.

● Implemented data preprocessing techniques and leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve good
accuracy in classifying thyroid types, contributing to early diagnosis and improved patient care.
